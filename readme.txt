A New and Improved Way to Link to Your Work: Suite101 Writers' Widget

We've been working hard over the past couple of months to give writers better
tools to link to their own articles, as well as pages that support their work.
We're proud to be releasing a new wordpress widget that will allow writers to
link back to their work from the sidebars of their self-hosted wordpress blogs!

What's new?

 * The new widget is much improved in the design department, with writers having three design layouts to choose from. There will be a layout that works with your blog for sure.
 * In addition, this widget provides spiderable, search friendly links back to article pages. This is a big step up from the old widget, which did not have spiderable links to articles.
 * Lastly, the widget contains links to upper level pages where your work appears – and you can choose these pages when setting up your widget! Stronger pages make sure that your articles get the most internal support possible.

== Installation ==

1. Install automatically through the `Plugins`, `Add New` menu in WordPress, or upload the `suite101-writerwidget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. Follow the message at the top of your screen to get to the configuration page.
4. First, enter in your profile URL. Then, select the section, topic and category you contribute to most often.
5. Follow the on-screen message, and drag-and-drop the widget onto your sidebar.
